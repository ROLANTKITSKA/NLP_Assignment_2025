🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Assignment 2025

Official GitHub repository for the 2025 NLP Assignment of the Spring Semester at the Department Of Informatics - University of Piraeus,Greece. 

📌 Overview

This project explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can be used to reconstruct or paraphrase text while preserving its semantic meaning. It evaluates different strategies ranging from traditional vector-based similarity to modern transformer-based language models.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- Python 3.10 (Core Language)
- Jupyter Notebooks (Interactive code and notes)
- FLAN-T5,T5 Paraphraser, BART (for paraphrastic reconstruction)
- Word2Vec embeddings, Cosine similarity, PCA visualization (for semantic similarity scoring)

🔍 Objectives
- Preserve meaning while paraphrazing
- Measure the semantic distance between original and reconstructed versions
- Compare effectiveness of different NLP models
- Visualize shifts in word semantics before and after reconstruction

🧰 Libraries Used
- gensim (for Word2Vec embeddings)
- sklearn (for cosine similarity & PCA)
- transformers (for FLAN-T5, BART, and T5-Paraphraser)
- matplotlib (for embedding visualizations)
- numpy (for vector math)

- HuggingFace Transformers
- Gensim & Scikit-learn
- Google Research (FLAN-T5)
- Facebook AI (BART)
